## Detecting Laser Points ##

This project aims to locate the positions of red LASER points in underwater images. It is a work in progress.
So far it uses HAAR cascade, and trains it using the training algorithm available in openCV, opencv_traincascade.exe. 

Here is an example of a successful detection using HAAR cascade.
